To do list
#Discuss with knowledgeable programmer
    - Am I messing up tracking the call? I.e what scope/state should I be tracking the call in? local? or game? 
    - Review make card static function
        - How to loop through cards in hand & append the respective card based on the input
    

To Do: 

Select cards only works if the input is exactly alike. that means find a way to format the generation of the list to match .strip.lower inputs so that user inputs dont need to be hyperspecific
